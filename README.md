### By using a waterproof temperature sensor to get the reading of the liquid’s temperature. Based on that temperature taking decision whether the temperature is too hot for the baby to drink or too cold. Here –
   - Red light – indicates too hot.
   - Green light – indicates perfect temperature.
   - Blue light – indicates too Cold.
When the temperature is perfect, a buzzer also makes noise to alert that now it’s ok to feed the baby.
